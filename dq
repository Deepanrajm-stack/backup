This notebook performs post-ingestion data quality (DQ) validation on the routingiq_json_input_data table. It applies a series of business and technical DQ rules to identify missing, inconsistent, or duplicate data. If any issues are detected, the notebook generates a summary report, exports sample records to Excel, and sends an automated email notification to the relevant stakeholders.
